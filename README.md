# UK-Dale Dataset Analysis and Prediction

### Resampling_Readings_and_Recording_Equipment_On_Off_States

- Resamples the input channel data (Appliance data) according to the input provided. (30 min in this case)
- Categorizes the reading into On/Off states based on threashold value.
- Records the time for On states and records 0 for off states based on the threshold value.
- Saves the data into .npy files in the specified location.

### Apriori_Analysis

- Reads the resampled output generated by **_Resampling_Readings_and_Recording_Equipment_On_Off_States_** notebook.
- Defines the time period for analysis
- Generates dates and time stamps for the specified period.
- Generates set of sequences of the appliances turned on for these time stamps for the specified time period.
- Provides these sequences as input to the apriori algorithm
- Prints out the patterns

### How to run

1. Install mlxtend library used for apriori algorithm.
2. Change path to a specific house in the UK-Dale dataset in the **_Resampling_Readings_and_Recording_Equipment_On_Off_States_** notebook.
3. Run the **_Resampling_Readings_and_Recording_Equipment_On_Off_States_** notebook.
4. Run the **_Apriori_Analysis_** notebook to generate patterns.
